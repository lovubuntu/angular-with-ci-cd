# AngularWithCiCd

This project was created to demonstrate CI/CD using travis for angular. Textual explanation of the same can be found in [My Blog](https://medium.com/@getprabuk/angular-6-travis-ci-with-headless-chrome-58fab1b394e1)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Running all tests

Run `yarn all_tests` to execute lint, unit and end-to-end tests
